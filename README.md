# PEP 0008

## Introduction

> "Code is read much more often than it is written."

Many developers find themselves developing their own style as they improve their programming skills. They may feel that since there is a consistent style to their code that anyone can work with it. However, this consistency is "self-standardized" and will only lead to problems when other developers try to work with the code. While it may be difficult for most experienced developers to change their style after years of practice, it is important for large (as well as small) software development teams to adhere to a style guide for a particular language. This will ensure that anyone with knowledge of a style guide will be able to work with the teams code.

This guide is intended to provide explanations and examples of coding style for writing Python code. We will focus on the styles provided in PEP 0008. The full guide can be found at [PEP 0008] (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

This guide will be broken into the following sections.
