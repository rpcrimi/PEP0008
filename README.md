# PEP0008

## Introduction

"Code is read much more often than it is written."

Many developers find themselves developing their own style as they progress their programming skills. They may feel that since there is a consistent style to their code that anyone can work with it. However, this consistency is "self-standardized" and will only lead to problems when other developers try to work with the code. While it may be difficult for most experienced developers to change their style after years of practice, it is important for large (as well as small) software development teams to adhere to a style guide for a particular language. This will ensure that anyone with knowledge of a style guide will be able to work with the teams code.

This guide is intended to provide explenations and examples of coding style for writing Python code.
