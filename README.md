# PEP 0008

## Introduction

> "Code is read much more often than it is written."

Many developers find themselves developing their own styles as they improve their programming skills. They may feel that since because their code seems to have a consistant style, others will be able to work with it easily. However, the code may actually only be "self-standardized" in that the consistancy only applies to the developer who created it. This may lead to problems when other developers try to work with that developer's code. 

While it may be difficult for most experienced developers to change their style after years of practice, it is important for large (as well as small) software development teams to adhere to a style guide to ensure true concistancy. This will ensure that anyone referring to the style guide will be better able to work with the teams code.

This guide is intended to provide explanations and examples of coding style for writing Python code. We will focus on the styles provided in PEP 0008. The full guide can be found at [PEP 0008] (https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
